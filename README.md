## 📂 Portfolio Overview

This portfolio showcases real-world networking and cybersecurity projects including:

- 🖥️ **Network Design & Device Configuration**  
- 🌐 **IP Addressing, DHCP & VLAN Implementation**  
- 📡 **Routing Protocols** (OSPF, inter-VLAN)  
- 🔒 **Access Control & Security Measures**  
- 🛠️ **Troubleshooting & Network Optimization**  

Each project is **fully documented**, with step-by-step configurations and screenshots for easy replication and learning.
